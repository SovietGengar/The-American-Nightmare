 THE_AMERICAN_NIGHTMARE_LOC:0 "Over 25 years have passed since the collapse of the United States of America. Communism appeared triumphat as the great Capitalist power fragmented into bickering states. But Socialism's victory is incomplete. Nations like Britain and France still cling to Capitalism, desperate to repel the Red tide. The Soviet Union stands alone as the world's great power, for now... Is the Cold War truly over?"
 SOV_AMERICAN_NIGHTMARE_DESC_LOC:0 "The Soviet Union has not fared well in the last 20 years. The rise of the German Democratic Republic has threatened Moscow's domination of Central and Eastern Europe, Several SSRs have seen widespread independence movements, and the Sino-Soviet split threatens to ignite a Second Cold War. Gorbecheav's reforms in the 80's and 90's helped stabilize the country somewhat, but an attempted coup by Communist Hardliners in 1995 brought all Democratization and Privatization to a screeching halt. The Soviet Union now stands as a shaky half-democratic, half-authoritarian socialist state led by Boris Yeltsin. The Union's future is an enigma to even it's leaders."
 GER_AMERICAN_NIGHTMARE_DESC_LOC:0 "The collapse of the United States brought a swift reunification of West and East Germany. The West was all but forced into annexation by the forces of the Soviet Union and East Germany, causing some 2 million West Germans to flee across the world in what is known as Der Westflug. The spirit of German Capitalism lives on in most of the country, and regions like Bavaria have seen mass unrest in recent years. Germany stands as the great challenger to the Soviet's dominance of the Eastern Bloc. Is it time for Germany to once again dominate Europe?"
 USA_AMERICAN_NIGHTMARE_DESC_LOC:0 "The Watergate Scandal was the straw that broke the camel's back. The growing left wing forces in the United States declared their own nations, opposed to the tyranny and corruption of the Federal Government. Before the Unites States Military could move to crush them, other states also broke away from the union. Martial Law was declared, but to no avail. Within the span of two weeks, the United States of America had been reduced to a rump state run by the Army. 27 years later, and the president is little more than a figurehead. Congress only provides rubber stamps, and the Military is in control. Has the American Dream finally perished?"
 FRA_AMERICAN_NIGHTMARE_DESC_LOC:0 "The 20th Century was a disaster for France. World War I was at best a phyrric and temporary victory over the Germans. This was followed by severe political crises in the 30's and a disasterous loss to Germany in 1940. Much of France was destroyed, and afterwards much of the Colonial Empire would break away over the next 20 years. The Fourth Republic was a mess from Day 1, leading to a Coup by de Gaulle in 1958. Charles de Gaulle established the 5th Republic, an Authoritarian State bearing ressemblance to Vichy. The Anglo-French and Anglo-German rivalries have been ressurected in recent years as well. Can France survive another century?"
 ENG_AMERICAN_NIGHTMARE_DESC_LOC:0 "The Sun has not yet set on the British Empire. Sure, most of what remains of the Empire are small islands and insignificant holdings strewn around the world, but the British Empire is still alive. This was cemented with the crushing defeat Argentina suffered in 1982 to the hands of the Iron Maiden. Though, not all is well. The Troubles seem to be entering it's 5th decade and the collapse of America and re-emerging Anglo-French enmity jeopordize Britain's diplomatic situation. But the new century promises a New Era. Or does it? Maybe it's time for the old order to return, maybe it's time for Britannia to once again rule the waves."
 ITA_AMERICAN_NIGHTMARE_DESC_LOC:0 "Italy has been home to a massive Socialist movement since the ideology's very inception. But it wasn't until 1981 that it would finally take control over Italy. The Italian Revisionary State is one of the world's first Revisionist Communist countries. This of course, has won them no favor in the diplomatic courts of Paris OR Moscow. They have few friends, and many enemies. Many Italian states thought long dead have re-emerged in the chaos of the Post-American world. And France specifically has greatly expanded it's sphere in the peninsula. Reunifying Italy will require another Resorgimento, but can it be done in the face of such odds?"
 JAP_AMERICAN_NIGHTMARE_DESC_LOC:0 "World War II saw the bloody end of the old Japan. The Emperor, after a long and fierce battle, was finally brought to trial for his crimes. But before he could face his sentence, a lowly US Private, who's name is forgotten to most, shot the condemned Emperor in his Palace in an act of vengeance. This triggered a widespread revolt across Japan, which was put down by brutal force by Douglas Macarthur. But rather than establish a Republic, he chose to coronate himself as emperor, believing the presence of an emperor vital to Japan's stability. He became the American Yuan, and brought forth the new Japan."
 OTHER_AMERICAN_NIGHTMARE_DESC_LOC:0 "The World has entered the 21st century, a new era filled to the brim with numerous squabbling nation-states. It's more than possible that any one of these could rise to prominance, esspecially those of the old United States and old colonial regimes that used to cover much of the world."
