 dick_cheney_desc:0 "Dick Cheney quickly fell into the favor of the American Armed Forces following the collapse of the United States in 1973 after the Watergate scandal due to his tendency to rise up the political ladder which led to him being elected as the current president of the Federal Enclave. However, he’s gained a rather prominent following of supporters after his speech in Arlington where he claimed that he’s a mere puppet of the Armed Forces who -in reality- rule the country at the expense of the interests of the American people. The future of the Federal Enclave is uncertain as the practices of the armed forces continue to be exposed to the general citizenry of the state."
 gordon_hinckley_desc:0 "Gordon B. Hinckley took power in Utah by exploiting the chaos caused by the collapse of the federal government. He orchestrated a coup d’etat against the Utah governor in 1974 supported by the underground Children of Christ movement which advocated for religious purity within Utah. Many have come to fear Hinckley as he was proclaimed the President of the Church (the Mormon’s version of a Pope) in 1982 as his missionaries have instigated distrust between believers and their governments abroad. Since then, Utah has become a safe haven for Mormons all around the world while accumulating wealth from his churches around the world. However, rumors have risen that Hinckley is encouraging rebellion through the use of missionaries in rural areas all over the former United States and Africa."
 boris_yeltsin_desc:0 "Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin is, in an ironic twist of fate, a man who almost perfectly sums up the “American Dream”. Born to impoverished parents in a small village, Yeltsin worked in construction after graduating from college. He joined the Communist Party in 1961 and quickly rose through its ranks, becoming first secretary of the party’s Sverdlovsk Oblast in 1976. An initial supporter of Gorbachev’s Perestroika and Glasnost reforms, Yeltsin would later characterize the reforms as being too moderate, instead favoring a transition into a multi-party democracy. His image as a popular anti-establishment figure was further bolstered when he became the first man to resign from the Politburo in 1987. In 1990 he was elected chair of the Russian Supreme Soviet and became the President of the RSFSR a year later. Yeltsin’s support of Gorbachev would prove instrumental in defeating the attempted hardliner coup in 1992, and when the Premier died three years later, Yeltsin was appointed as his successor. However, Yeltsin would find actually implementing his reforms to be a much more difficult task. Boris Yeltsin must navigate the channels of power, working past the demands of hardliners and ethnic minorities to shape the Soviet Union into his vision. Then, he can finally rest on his laurels, knowing that he is the man who has propelled Russia into the modern age."
